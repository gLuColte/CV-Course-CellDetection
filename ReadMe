These files are for COMP9517 Computer Vision 2020 T2 Project
Created by: Group 1
Sample Video and and presentation is provided 
To run the overall file:
1) Copy and paste raw images into RawData, do not change the names
2) Run generate_model.py with the given requirements in requirements.txt. Output directories of predicted outcome will be generated
3) Run Split_Raw_img.py in order to split the output image from UNET to segmented and distance transformed
4) Run respective dataset's post-processing.py in order to perform post processing
5) Run Box_Drawing_script.py to perform detection and tracking:
    - Note, requested output for Task 1,2,3 are printed on output image (3D graph), pop up of image window is deleted as
    it largely stops the overall process, hence focusing on post-processing video for visualizaiton of output
    - Terminal is mainly for tracking process  and providing command in executing
    - Motion analysis for a single cell can be performed at the end of each sequence run by inputting the cell-id
    desired for tracking, cell-id can be retrieved from annotation html file under Results-Annotation
6) Respective Static results are shown:
    - Results-Annotation Directory: Per frame motion analysis of cells
    - Results-BoundaryBox: Drawing of cell boundary box with trajectory (note id is not labelled as it caused clustering
    making un-visible image in Dataset 3 - PhC-C2DL-PSC)
    - Results-PathImage: Drawing of trajectory per frame with requested Task 1 and 2, total cell count and division count
7) Run Video_creator.py for putting all output together into a simple avi output video
    - output video will be placed under respective folder for each Dataset, Results-Video
